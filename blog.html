                        and Const</strong>
                    in JS and their
                    Differences?

                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-medium pl-2 mb-2 border-l-4 border-red-700">Overview</p>
                <p>The <strong>var, let, and const</strong> are the main keywords to declare variables in javascript.
                    The var
                    variable is an old method to declare a variable in javascript. In modern javascript, we use the let
                    and const variable,
                    which was introduced in the <strong>ES6</strong> update; now, the let and const variable is used
                    more
                    frequently in modern javascript as compared to the var variable.</p> <br>
                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-1 text-red-800">Var</p>
                <p>Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared
                    with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge.var is
                    function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be
                    accessed only within that function. Var variables can be re-declared and updated. <br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-1 text-red-800">Let</p>
                <p>Let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var
                    declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is
                    so. Just like var, a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let
                    variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. Also, since a variable cannot be declared more than
                    once within a scope, then the problem discussed earlier that occurs with var does not happen. <br>
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-1 text-red-800">Const</p>
                <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some
                    similarities with let declarations. This means that the value of a variable declared with const
                    remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable
                    with const.<br> <br>

                        class="text-red-800">Var, Let, and
                        Const</strong>
                    in Javascript
                </p>
                <p>The main difference between <strong>var, let, and const</strong> in JavaScript lies in their
                    <strong>SCOPE</strong>
                    and <strong>MUTABILITY</strong>. Var
                    is function-scoped and can be both re-declared and updated, making it the more flexible, yet
                    potentially riskier option from older JavaScript standards. In contrast, Let, introduced in ES6, is
                    block-scoped and can only be updated, not re-declared, offering a middle ground between flexibility
                    and predictability. Const, also an ES6 addition, is block-scoped like Let but cannot be updated or
                    re-declared, making it the strictest option for variable declarations, ideal for values that should
                    remain constant throughout the code.

                <p>
                    In JavaScript, <strong>null</strong> and <strong>undefined</strong> are two distinct values that are
                    often used to
                    represent the
                    absence of a value or an uninitialized variable. However, they are used in slightly different
                    contexts. <strong>Null</strong> in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in
                    JavaScript.
                    The variable
                    which has been assigned as null contains no value. <strong>Undefined</strong>, on the other hand,
                    means the variable
                    has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. </p><br>

                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-1"> What is <strong
                        class=" text-red-800">Null</strong>?
                </p>
                <p>We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value.
                    The
                    same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming. <br> <br>

                    Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as
                    null contains no value. When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or
                    blank. It is to show
                    that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to a
                    variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually by the user as
                    JavaScript never sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.</p>

                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-1"> What is <strong
                        class=" text-red-800">Undefined</strong>?
                </p>
                <p>There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a programmer, it is
                    important that we understand it clearly. <br> <br>

                    As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a
                    value to it, the variable becomes undefined. <br>

                    Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets
                    created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value
                    is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.

                <p>
                    There are several differences between null and undefined, which are sometimes understood as the
                    same.

                <P>A <strong>REST API</strong> (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API
                    or web API) that
                    conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web
                    services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy
                    Fielding.</P>
                <p><br><br>
                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-1"> What is <strong
                        class=" text-red-800">API</strong>?
                </p>
                <p> An <strong>API</strong> is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating
                    application
                    software. It's sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an
                    information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content
                    required by the
                    producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the
                    user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high
                    temperature, and the second being the low.</p> <br>

                In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform
                a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and
                fulfill the request. <br>

                You can think of an API as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or web services
                they want to get. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while
                maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to.
                <br><br>

                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-1"> What is <strong
                        class=" text-red-800">REST</strong>?
                </p>

                <p> <strong>Rest</strong> is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a
                    standard. API
                    developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.</p> <br>

                <p>When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the
                    resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of
                    several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text.
                    JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it’s
                    language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines. <br>

                    Something else to keep in mind: Headers and parameters are also important in the HTTP methods of a
                    RESTful API HTTP request, as they contain important identifier information as to the request's
                    metadata, authorization, uniform resource identifier (URI), caching, cookies, and more. There are
                    request headers and response headers, each with their own HTTP connection information and status
                    codes.</p>
